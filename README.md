# React Hello World

üëã üåè Hello, world in React

## Objectives

In this exercise you will learn

- to create React elements with `React.createElement()`
- to create React elements with JSX syntax
- to render React elements with `ReactDOM.render()`

## Instructions

Create an `h1` tag with the content "Hello, world!" and append it to `<div id="app"></div>`.

First, let's do this in vanilla JavaScript by manipulating the DOM directly.

Next, we will try to do the same thing in React by creating a React element with `React.createElement()` and using `ReactDOM.render()` to render it to the DOM.

Finally, we will use JSX to create a React element.

## React

React provides a `createElement` method that creates a React element of a given type, which can be an HTML tag name (e.g. `div`, `h1`, etc.), a React component, or a React fragment.

```js
React.createElement(type)
```

For instance, `React.createElement('div')` will create a `<div></div>` element. To add text in the element you can specify that in the third argument, like so:

```js
React.createElement('div', null, 'Some interesting content here')
```

which results in `<div>Some interesting content here</div>`.

## ReactDOM

ReactDOM provides a `render` method that renders a React element into the DOM in the specified container.

```js
ReactDOM.render(element, container);
```

You would use `React.createElement()` to create the React element.

You could use `document.querySelector()` to select the container where you want to place your React element in.

## JSX

Each JSX element is just syntactic sugar for calling `React.createElement()`. This means that instead of creating a React element with `React.createElement()`, we can instead use JSX.

We can see this in action [here](https://babeljs.io/repl/#?presets=react&code_lz=GYVwdgxgLglg9mABACwKYBt1wBQEpEDeAUIogE6pQhlIA8AJjAG4B8AEhlogO5xnr0AhLQD0jVgG4iAXyJA).

In order to use JSX, we need to get Babel to help transpile our JavaScript files for us.

First, we have to add the Babel library in our `index.html`

```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6/babel.min.js"></script>
```

Next, add `type="text/babel"` to our `<script>` tag where we want Babel to transpile

```
<script defer type="text/babel" src="app.js"></script>
```
